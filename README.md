# Hello my name is Mahmoud 
Here's some information to understand the written code


# Part JSX with ( Parent )
-   If you are dealing with the parent, give instructions that do not have a change in value, such as
    overflow-hidden , position , flexBox (flex , items-center , justify-(center - between , etc..) )

-   If there is a change in the value, such as 
    margin , padding , width , height , color , fontSize , etc... and any property include number write it in a file CSS so that it is easy to edit and understand

This Great , complete the part of dealing with children, please

# Part JSX with ( children )
-   If there is a specific one that you want for all children, write it in the css file
